NO!! you cannot edit the settings for this plugin!!
Becuse there are none, if you feel so inclined just open your ide and change the css yourself if your that botherd by it!!
Settings menu coming in V2 Don't Worry \ 
If wondering just move the .js file into your plugins folder on better discord. I doubt this would work on any other discord client mod that isnt better discord. 100% LEGAL WILL NOT GET YOU BANNED
